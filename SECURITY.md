# üîí Security Guide - P2E Gaming Platform

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the P2E Gaming Platform to protect sensitive data, ensure secure deployments, and maintain best practices for blockchain application development.

## üîê Environment Variable Security

### **Secure Configuration**

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Store sensitive data in environment variables
- Use `.env.local` for local development
- Add all `.env*` files to `.gitignore`
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix ONLY for non-sensitive client-side variables
- Validate all environment variables on startup

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Commit `.env` files to version control
- Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for sensitive data
- Store private keys or mnemonics in source code
- Hardcode API keys or secrets

### **Environment File Structure**

```
.env.example          # Template with placeholder values
.env.local           # Local development (never commit)
.env.testnet.example # Testnet template
.env.production.example # Production template
```

### **Variable Classification**

**Public Variables (Safe for client-side):**
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_STACKS_API_URL=https://api.testnet.hiro.so
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=ST...
```

**Private Variables (Server-side only):**
```env
DEPLOYMENT_MNEMONIC=your-mnemonic-here
DEPLOYMENT_PRIVATE_KEY=your-key-here
API_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-here
```

## üîë Private Key Protection

### **Key Management Best Practices**

1. **Never Store Keys in Plain Text**
   - Use secure key derivation from mnemonic
   - Implement key encryption for local storage
   - Use hardware wallets for production

2. **Secure Key Derivation**
   ```bash
   # Use secure key manager script
   node scripts/secure-key-manager.js
   ```

3. **Production Key Management**
   - Use hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor)
   - Implement secure key management services
   - Use multi-signature wallets for critical operations

### **Deployment Security**

```bash
# Secure deployment script
node scripts/secure-deploy.js
```

**Features:**
- Prompts for sensitive inputs at runtime
- Never logs or stores private keys
- Validates all inputs before deployment
- Uses secure environment variable handling

## üö® Security Monitoring

### **Automated Checks**

The platform includes automated security validation:

1. **Environment Validation**
   - Checks required variables on startup
   - Validates network configuration
   - Ensures HTTPS endpoints

2. **Security Audit**
   - Scans for exposed sensitive data
   - Validates environment variable naming
   - Checks for security violations

3. **Runtime Monitoring**
   - Logs security events
   - Monitors for suspicious activity
   - Validates all blockchain transactions

### **Security Components**

```typescript
// Automatic security validation
import { SecurityProvider } from '@/components/security/SecurityProvider';

// Environment validation
import { validateEnvironmentVariables, performSecurityAudit } from '@/lib/stacks';
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Tools

### **Key Management**
```bash
# Secure key manager
node scripts/secure-key-manager.js

# Options:
# 1. Validate mnemonic phrase
# 2. Derive address from mnemonic
# 3. Generate deployment configuration
# 4. Validate environment variables
```

### **Secure Deployment**
```bash
# Secure deployment script
node scripts/secure-deploy.js

# Features:
# - Runtime input prompting
# - Balance validation
# - Security confirmation
# - No sensitive data storage
```

## üîí Production Security

### **Mainnet Deployment**

For production mainnet deployment:

1. **Use Hardware Wallets**
   - Ledger or Trezor for key storage
   - Never expose private keys to software

2. **Multi-Signature Setup**
   - Require multiple signatures for critical operations
   - Distribute signing authority

3. **Secure Infrastructure**
   - Use secure hosting providers
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Regular security audits

4. **Monitoring & Alerts**
   - Real-time transaction monitoring
   - Automated security alerts
   - Regular security assessments

## üìã Code Review Requirements

### **Pre-Commit Checklist**
- [ ] No sensitive data in code changes
- [ ] Environment variables follow naming conventions
- [ ] No hardcoded addresses or keys
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented
- [ ] Security tests pass

### **Review Process**
1. **Automated Scans**
   - Git hooks scan for secrets
   - Environment variable validation
   - Security linting rules

2. **Manual Review**
